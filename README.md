This project classifies gender based on eye images


### Observations:

Model Performance: comparing the model performance, I have observed the following:

Model 1a (SVM) and Model 1b (KNN Classifier) are considered as benchmark models. They provide a baseline for performance comparison.

Model 2 (MLP) is a multilayer perceptron neural network, and Model 3 (CNN) is a convolutional neural network. These two models are more complex and specialized for image data.

Accuracy: The accuracy of the models may vary based on the dataset and the preprocessing steps. Generally, CNNs tend to perform well on image data, but it is important to tune hyperparameters and consider data augmentation techniques to avoid overfitting.

Precision and Recall: Precision and Recall are essential metrics for imbalanced datasets, where one class dominates the other. In gender classification like the this, imbalanced classes are common, and both precision and recall are crucial. A high precision means that the model makes fewer false positive predictions, while a high recall indicates that the model captures a significant number of true positive cases.

### Conclusion:

Based on the observations and performance metrics, i made following conclusions:

Model 1a (SVM) and Model 1b (KNN Classifier) provide reasonable baseline performance for the gender classification task using eye data. They both shows precision of 89% and 81% respectively, that provesa less false positive predition in the model.

Model 2 (MLP) can capture more complex patterns in the data and potentially perform better with appropriate hyperparameter tuning. Regularization techniques like dropout can be used to prevent overfitting. Based the on the result MLP show a high false predition of with 56% of precision value and accuracy of 51%. which is basically the lowest compared to other models.

Model 3 (CNN) can leverage spatial information in the eye images. CNN is specifically designed for image classification dataset. It has the potential to outperform the other models, especially when working with larger image datasets. CNN model show a good result based on the Precision value of 81%.

I implemented Hyperparameter tuning, including learning rates, batch sizes, number of layers, and neurons, can significantly impact model performance. implemented early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.

Lastly, the choice of the best model depends on the specific dataset and the available computational resources. For small datasets, a simpler model like SVM or KNN may suffice. As the dataset size increases and the complexity of the task grows, neural network models like MLP and CNN become more advantageous. Proper evaluation and hyperparameter tuning are crucial to achieving the best performance. Also, data augmentation, and regularization techniques play a vital role in improving model performance and preventing overfitting.
